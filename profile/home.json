    "about": "I am a Master's student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University. At CMU, I am exploring my interest in robotics planning & control. I joined the Biorobotics lab to work on Modular Robot: EigenBot under Professor Howie Choset and Scientist Lu Li. I also worked on MMPUG as a Research Assistant under Professor Matthew J. Travers.\n\nBesides, I am still interested in Graph Learing and the intersections of Graph and LLM, working on Graph Privacy under Professor Carl Yang.\n\nBefore coming to CMU, I worked on adversarial attacks on graphs and unsupervised graph learning under Prof. Di Jin and his Ph.D. student Bingdao Feng. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tianjin University in 2023.\n\n During my undergraduate studies, I also completed a full-time internship in .NET web development at E2Biz SoftTech (Tianjin) Co.
