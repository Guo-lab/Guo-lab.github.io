    "about": "I am a Master's student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). At CMU, I am pursuing my interest in robotics planning & control. I joined the Biorobotics lab to work on Modular Robot: EigenBot under the guidance of Professor Howie Choset and Researcher Lu Li. In this role, I designed curve-walking control algorithm in simulation, contributed to the hardware development of this bio-inspired distributed control system, and evaluated performance metrics based on data collected with OptiTrack. Additionally, I have collaborated on the project MMPUG as a Research Assistant with Dr. Matthew J. Travers. My contributions included implementing the Global Planner for UGVs, integrating the planning module into MMPUG-a user-friendly autonomous vehicle system-and designing and carrying out extensive simulation testing, followed by validating the planner's performance on real RC cars.\n\nBesides, I am still interested in Graph Learing and the intersections of Graph and LLM, working on Graph Privacy under Professor Carl Yang. During this remote research journey, I explored model privacy risk by designing Membership Inference Attack on Reasoning-on-Graph and LLaGA.\n\nBefore coming to CMU, I worked on adversarial attacks on graphs and unsupervised graph learning under the guidance of Prof. Di Jin and his Ph.D. student Bingdao Feng. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tianjin University in 2023.\n\n During my undergraduate studies, I also completed a full-time internship in .NET web development at E2Biz SoftTech (Tianjin) Co. Ltd.",
