# EigenBot: Distributed Control for Modular Robotics

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a biologically-inspired distributed control system for modular robots, specifically targeting six-legged locomotion patterns observed in insects.

## Key Achievements

- **Implemented curve walking algorithm** in CoppeliaSim, inspired by six-leg insects' behavior, based on a biologically inspired distributed control framework

- **Developed Eigenbot EEPROM parameters auto-setting tools**, accelerating Hexapod gaits tuning process

- **Tested firmware and communication protocols** - debugged the modules' communication protocol & redesigned topology structure to ensure the robot's stability and reliability

- **Built comprehensive testing environment** - setup motion capture system & recorded motion data for performance analysis

## Technical Implementation

The project involved multiple technical challenges:

### Control Algorithm Design
The curve walking algorithm was developed to mimic natural insect locomotion patterns, providing efficient and stable movement for the modular robot system.

### Hardware Integration
EEPROM parameter management tools were created to streamline the configuration process, making it easier to tune and optimize robot gaits for different scenarios.

### System Validation
Extensive testing was conducted using motion capture technology to validate the performance of the distributed control system and ensure reliable operation.
